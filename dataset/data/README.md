# TinyCenterSpeed Dataset

TinyCenterSpeed is trained on real-life data recorded in the form of Rosbags. 
These are then converted into CSV files for training, which strore the sparse lidar information and ground truths.
The information is then preprocessed into images in bird's eye view (BEV) during training.

TinyCenterSpeed provides:

* __CenterSpeedDataset__: The dataset used for training TinyCenterSpeed.
* __validation_set__: A validation set to monitor training progress.

All of the datasets and Rosbags can be freely downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CzWXwncxt6HtNSDTg8RbXdfaRSdgQ_ce?usp=drive_link)
