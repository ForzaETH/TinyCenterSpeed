# Training

These notebooks provide the training code for TinyCenterSpeed.

* `train_centerspeed.ipynb`: training the old 1.0 model.
* `train_centerspeed_dense.ipynb`: training the final TinyCenterSpeed model.
* `train_simple_model.ipynb`: training a simpler model without preprocessing to images.

`train.py` specifies different variations of training loops for different scenarios.
